                  <div class="small-12 column">        
                      <p>Dear Reader,</p>

                      <p>Today, I&rsquo;m going to show you how to use America&rsquo;s budding Marijuana market to potentially amass a quick fortune&hellip;</p>

                      <p>Starting with just two simple things:</p>

                      <ol class="darkGreen numbers">
                        <li>A little $50 bill.</li>
                        <li>The coming November 8 vote to legalize weed and medicinal marijuana across more than seven states.</li>
                      </ol>

                      <p>And all you have to do is copy this &ldquo;secret weed stock blueprint&rdquo; and you could retire incredibly wealthy in less than a year.</p>

                      <p>Sound impossible? It&rsquo;s not!</p>

                      <p>To make it work&hellip;</p>

                      <div class="greenstripe">
                        <div class="inner-wrapper">
                            <ul class="orangeCheck">
                              <strong>
                                <li>You do <span class="not">NOT</span> need to know anything about marijuana (in fact, the less you know, the better&hellip; since you won&rsquo;t be biased)...</li>
                                <li>You do <span class="not">NOT</span> need to know anything about investing...</li>
                                <li>You do <span class="not">NOT</span> need a lot of money (only $50 to start)...</li>
                                <li>And you do <span class="not">NOT</span> need a lot of free time.</li>
                              </strong>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                      </div>
                      <p>But, you DO need to know how to get rich (including what pot stocks to buy, when to buy them, and how much to pay for them)&hellip;</p>

                      <p>This is where I can help.</p>

                      <p>But if you&rsquo;d rather watch your dreams about becoming a millionaire dissolve before your eyes like a puff of smoke&hellip;</p>

                      <p>Then stop reading right now.</p>

                      <p>Still with me? Great!</p>

                      <p>Let me explain how easy it is&hellip;</p>

                      <p>What you&rsquo;re about to see is a little-known stock market investing secret.</p>

                      <p>Don&rsquo;t worry if you&rsquo;ve never bought a stock before. It&rsquo;s as easy as checking your email (or making a quick phone call). Anyone can do it&hellip;</p>

                      <p>But here&rsquo;s the catch&hellip;</p>

                      <p>This will only work if you&rsquo;re willing to stake a claim in the marijuana industry&hellip;</p>

                      <p>And it will only work if you take action BEFORE November 8th&hellip;</p>

                      <p>...while the majority of marijuana related stocks still trade for &ldquo;pennies&rdquo; a share.</p>

                      <p>Once the November 8th date passes, these tiny little penny stocks will soon turn into the big, expensive stocks like Wal-Mart or Coca-Cola&hellip;</p>

                      <p>Then it will be too late to make any money.</p>

                      <p>See, the &ldquo;Secret $50 Marijuana Stock Blueprint&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t work with big stocks.</p>

                      <p>It only works when these pot stocks trade for &ldquo;pennies.&rdquo;</p>

                      <h3>Why Penny Pot Stocks?</h3>
            </div>

              <div class="wrapper-md center ">
                <div class="row ">
                  <div class="small-12 column">    
                      <p>There are thousands of penny stocks across all sectors of the markets&hellip;</p>

                      <p>Technology, commodities, health, agriculture, energy&hellip; you name it.</p>

                      <p>And what makes penny stocks different from other &ldquo;brand-name&rdquo; stocks is that they&rsquo;re little-known and cheap.</p>

                      <p>Extremely cheap!</p>

                      <p>And right now, in the marijuana industry, there are literally dozens and dozens of cheap, penny stocks.</p>
                      <div class="greenstripe">
                        <div class="inner-wrapper">

                      <p>But here&rsquo;s what you need to know right now&hellip;</p>

                      <div class="row">
                        <div class="medium-3 columns hide-for-small-only">
                            <img src="https://research.agorafinancial.com/reports/TEK/Pot-iHTML-1016/TEK-Pot-Icon_1016_001.png" alt="description" width="100%">

                          <h3>These pot stocks won&rsquo;t stay cheap for long</h3>
                        </div>
                      </div><!-- / row -->

                      

                      <p>See, because these penny pot stocks can go for as little as a few cents to a few dollars...</p>

                      <p>That means even first time investors can afford to do this.</p>

                      <p>The best part?</p>

                      <p>Penny pot stocks have a proven history of handing out truly explosive gains.</p>

                      <p>In fact, more often than not, they&rsquo;re the most profitable stocks on Wall Street.</p>

                      <p>It&rsquo;s easy to understand why, when you think about it.</p>

                      <p>With a big &ldquo;blue chip&rdquo; stock, it can take years&hellip; even decades for a $50 share to double&hellip; and turn into $100.</p>

                      <p>But with a penny stock, a 25-cent share can become a 50-cent share&hellip; or even a $2 share overnight.</p>

                      <p>In fact, it happens all the time.</p>

                      <p>Just look at this snapshot I took from today&rsquo;s biggest percentage gains in the markets:</p>
                      <img alt="Description" class="image_center chart-paper" src="http://research.agorafinancial.com/reports/TEK/Pot/TEK_SecretPotBlueprint_Stocks1_101816_1.jpg" />
                      <p>As you can see, there were eight different penny stocks that rocketed up over 1,000% in just the past 24 hours.</p>

                      <p>Eight different chances to change your life&hellip;</p>

                      <p>Eight different chances to grow rich...</p>

                      <p>In just a single day!</p>

                      <p>Now compare that to the biggest gainers from much bigger stocks.</p>
                      <img alt="Description" class="image_center chart-paper" src="http://research.agorafinancial.com/reports/TEK/Pot/TEK_SecretPotBlueprint_Stocks2_101816_2.jpg" />
                      <p>The biggest gains for the larger, &ldquo;blue chip&rdquo; companies was 34.79%.</p>

                      <p>The biggest percentage gain from penny stocks was an incredible 19,900%.</p>

                      <p>It&rsquo;s not even close.</p>

                      <p>And that was just from today&rsquo;s data.</p>

                      <p>It&rsquo;s the same scenario day after day.</p>

                      <p>Here&rsquo;s the bottom line:</p>

                      <p>Now, as good as that is&hellip;</p>

                      <p>There IS one problem&hellip;</p>

                      <p>It can be difficult to pinpoint the <em>exact moment</em> to invest in penny stocks.</p>

                      <p>But that&rsquo;s what makes today&rsquo;s situation with the marijuana markets so exciting!</p>

                      <p>We know the exact date that these &ldquo;penny pot&rdquo; stocks will explode!</p>

                      <p>In fact, the date&rsquo;s being handed to us on a silver platter.</p>

                      <p>You see, on November 8th, states from all over the country are set to vote on new marijuana legalization initiatives.</p>

                      <p>States like Arizona, Maine, Nevada, Massachusetts, Florida, Arkansas and of course, California &ndash; the most populated state in the country.</p>

                      <p>The polls are showing that most of these initiatives will easily pass&hellip;</p>

                      <p>That single decision could send dozens and dozens of marijuana penny stocks skyrocketing higher.</p>

                      <p>How can I be so sure?</p>

                      <p>Well, just look at what happened back in 2014&hellip;</p>

                      <p>When an almost identical situation took place.</p>

                      <p>Dozens and dozens of marijuana penny stocks simply exploded like gangbusters after Colorado passed similar legislation.</p>

                      <p>But Abattis Bioceuticals was able to do it in less than three months&hellip;</p>

                      <p>This didn&rsquo;t happen just once or twice&hellip; or even three times&hellip;</p>

                      <p>There were literally dozens more opportunities just like Abattis Bioceuticals&hellip;</p>

                      <p>Take Fusion Pharm, Inc., for example&hellip;</p>

                      <p>Again, this company was completely off most people&rsquo;s radar&hellip; they were trading for just over 38 cents per share on January 1st, 2014.</p>

                      <p>But immediately following Colorado&rsquo;s historic shift in marijuana legalization, share prices exploded.</p>

                      <p>Within one month, the stock hit a gain of 1,678%.</p>

                      <p>But it wasn&rsquo;t done&hellip;</p>

                      <p>By March 11th, just over two months later, it hit a total gain of 2,268%.</p>

                      <p>Or take a company called Novus Acquisition and Development Corp&hellip; their stock price exploded for a 3,540% gain from early January through late March&hellip;</p>

                    <p>So let me put that into perspective for you&hellip;</p>

                    <p>Just a single $1 bill invested in CBGI before its move&hellip;</p>

                    <p>Turned into $51.</p>

                    <p>Not bad, right?</p>

                    <p>But a $5 bill would have turned into $255&hellip;</p>

                    <p>A $50 bill into $2,550&hellip;</p>

                    <p>And $500 would have turned into more than $25,000.</p>

                    <p>That&rsquo;s just with one penny pot play!</p>

                    <p>A single move would have made you rich.</p>

                    <p>Again, these rare lightning-fast gains were incredible.</p>

                    <p>Can I promise that you&rsquo;re going to book these whopping gains in as little time? Of course not, no one can promise anything in the investment world.</p>

                    <p>But the point remains:</p>

                    <p>Penny stocks are the best ways to get rich in the stock market&hellip;</p>

                    <p>And when seven MORE states vote to legalize marijuana on November 8th, the publicly traded &ldquo;penny pot stocks&rdquo; could skyrocket in price.</p>

                    <p>So how much money can you make this time around&hellip; by investing just $50?</p>

                    <p>And why isn&rsquo;t everyone else doing this?</p>

                    <p>Allow me to show you&hellip;</p>

                  <p>If penny stocks are so great, you&rsquo;d expect everyone to harness their amazing profit building potential and get rich.</p>

                  <p>Especially for the chance to turn $50 into more than $2.7 million (I&rsquo;ll show you undeniable proof that you could make this much in just a moment!).</p>

                  <p>But that&rsquo;s not the case at all!</p>

                  <p>You see, penny stocks are so small, the &ldquo;<em>big boys</em>&rdquo; on Wall Street can&rsquo;t trade them.</p>

                  <p>This is because big investment firms can buy up millions of shares at a time&hellip;</p>

                  <p>But if the company they buy into is a penny stock, then share prices fly through the roof with a big order.</p>

                  <p>This immediately cuts into their potential profits, so a penny stock just isn&rsquo;t a sensible way to play the market, when you&rsquo;re a &ldquo;<em>big boy</em>.&rdquo;</p>

                  <p>However, they&rsquo;re great for the little guy and first time investors.</p>

                  <p>But because the &ldquo;big boys&rdquo; ignore them, the mainstream media typically does too.</p>

                  <p>This is why most people don&rsquo;t know much about penny stocks&hellip;</p>

                  <p>But just because penny stocks aren&rsquo;t mentioned on the news doesn&rsquo;t mean there&rsquo;s anything wrong with them.</p>

                  <p>The truth is, it&rsquo;s better this way&hellip;</p>

                  <p>Like I said, they&rsquo;re PROVEN to have outperformed the bigger stocks&hellip;</p>

                  <p>So let&rsquo;s keep this secret to ourselves.</p>

                  <p>Now, back to the question of, &ldquo;How much money can I make investing just $50 with these marijuana penny stocks?&rdquo;</p>

                  <p>Well, breathe deep&hellip; inhale&hellip; pay close attention&hellip; and I&rsquo;ll show you&hellip;</p>

                            <p>Step by step, I&rsquo;ll show you how $50 could have turned into more than $2.7 million.</p>

                            <p>Yes, this strategy is risky and requires a bit of luck.</p>

                            <p>I would never recommend it to my readers&hellip;</p>

                            <p>This is simply an &ldquo;accelerated&rdquo; example of how potent these marijuana penny stocks really can be.</p>

                            <p>That said&hellip;</p>

                            <p>These penny stock share price explosions actually happened (and around November 8, I fully expect it to happen again).</p>

                            <p>So although it&rsquo;s highly improbable you&rsquo;d be <em><u>this</u></em> lucky, it&rsquo;s <strong>NOT impossible</strong>. That&rsquo;s important to remember.</p>

                    <h3>Weed Stock Blueprint Step #1 <br class="hidebr"><strong>$50 Turns Into $1,316 <br class="hidebr">in 10 Months</strong></h3>

                      <p>CV Sciences Inc. (CVSI) is a marijuana therapeutic company based out of Nevada.</p>

                      <p>If you haven&rsquo;t heard of them before, then you&rsquo;re not alone.</p>

                      <p>Remember, the best profit opportunities (especially in penny marijuana stocks) are rarely featured on TV or covered by the financial newspapers.</p>

                      <p>At the start of marijuana&rsquo;s last big run, shares traded for a tiny $1.50.</p>

                      <p>That&rsquo;s cheap enough for anyone to buy...</p>

                      <p>And cheap enough for you to load up on dozens of shares with just $50.</p>

                      <p>But then it got really exciting&hellip;</p>

                      <p>Word of Colorado&rsquo;s new legislation to legalize pot began to spread, and shares rocketed!</p>

                      <p>By the middle of October 2013, a buying frenzy pushed shares of CV Sciences up to $41.</p>

                      <p>That&rsquo;s an incredible gain of 2,633% (in just over six months)!</p>

                      <p>If you bought shares at the very start and held on&hellip;</p>

                      <p>You could have quickly turned a $50 grubstake in CV Sciences into $1,316.</p>

                      <p>The best part?</p>

                      <p>Well, truth is there were many other companies like CV Sciences I could have chosen as an example.</p>

                      <p>Now&hellip;</p>

                      <p>That&rsquo;s a nice start&hellip;</p>

                      <p>But it&rsquo;s chump change compared to what&rsquo;s next.</p>

                      <p>Before we move on, though, let&rsquo;s suppose you put your original $50 back into your savings account.</p>

                      <p>Now you have 0% risk.</p>

                      <p>As in Z-E-R-O risk.</p>

                      <p>You&rsquo;re using nothing but &ldquo;house money,&rdquo; as we say in the investing world.</p>

                      <p>So you&rsquo;re going to roll that $1,266 of pure profit into the next step.</p>

                      <p>At this point, you really can&rsquo;t lose!</p>

                      <p>This is an excellent example of how powerful penny marijuana stocks can be when the timing is perfect (like what we can expect in November)&hellip;</p>

                      <p>You could have bought Easton Pharmaceuticals Inc. (EAPH) for less than a penny per share at the start of January 2014&hellip;</p>

                      <p>By February 7 &mdash; just over a month later &mdash; share prices had risen to 6.5 cents.</p>

                      <p>Now, Easton Pharmaceuticals didn&rsquo;t develop a new drug...</p>

                      <p>There was NO news of a &ldquo;buyout&rdquo; from a larger drug manufacturer.</p>

                      <p>Nope.</p>

                      <p>Just one simple thing pushed those shares higher&hellip;</p>

                      <p>This penny marijuana stock shot higher by an incredible 3,150%.</p>

                      <p>And had you invested your $1,266 profit from Step #1, the resulting mega-gain would have put a staggering $39,879 right in your pocket!</p>

                      <p>Not bad for a handful of &ldquo;mouse clicks&rdquo; and a few weeks of &ldquo;<em>work</em>.&rdquo;</p>

                      <p>Compare that with a big stock like Apple.</p>

                      <p>That&rsquo;s impressive&hellip; for a huge company.</p>

                      <p>BUT, before the jump&hellip;</p>

                      <p>Apple shares were already changing hands at $122.</p>

                      <p>So the biggest breakthrough in cellphone technology &mdash; heck, it was the biggest breakthrough in ANY technology &mdash; and you would have only bagged a measly 17% gain.</p>

                      <p>Now look at the marijuana stock Easton Pharmaceuticals again&hellip; it jumped a mouthwatering 3,150%...</p>

                      <p>In just over a month!</p>

                      <p>Now can you see the power of penny stocks?</p>

                      <p>And when you have the perfect investment scenario &mdash; like with these marijuana penny stocks &mdash; you&rsquo;d be hard pressed to find an easier way to get rich quickly.</p>

                      <p>To summarize&hellip;</p>

                      <p>Your $50 turned into $1,266 in pure profits with Step #1&hellip;</p>

                      <p>And then that $1,266 turned into $39,879 with Step #2...</p>

                      <p>But we&rsquo;re still not done.</p>

                      <p>I promised to show you how to turn $50 into $2.7 million.</p>

                      <p>And that takes one final step...</p>

                      <strong>More than $2.7 Million in <br class="hidebr">Just Over One Month!</strong></h3>

                      <p>It&rsquo;s hard to imagine that you could have become a multimillionaire simply by making just three moves...</p>

                      <p>But if you had rolled your profits from Step #1 and Step #2 into a marijuana company called CannaBusiness Group Inc. (CBGI), that&rsquo;s exactly what would have happened.</p>

                      <p>CannaBusiness Group&rsquo;s primary focus is on zoning issues regarding marijuana growing operations.</p>

                      <p>And in early 2014, business was good.</p>

                      <p>In fact, from February 7 to March 14&hellip; just over one month&#39;s time&hellip; share prices soared for a massive gain of 6,833%.</p>

                      <p>In other words, you&rsquo;d be a multimillionaire.</p>

                      <p>Incredible, right?</p>

                      <p>Just three simple moves&hellip;</p>

                      <p>So easy a fifth grader could have made them...</p>

                      <p>And all in all&hellip;</p>

                      <p>You&rsquo;d have just turned a tiny $50 grubstake into more than $2.7 million in around two years&rsquo; time.</p>

                      <p>Remember, this explosion in marijuana penny stocks actually happened...</p>

                      <p>That&rsquo;s the truth&hellip;</p>

                      <p>Go ahead, look it up for yourself when you&rsquo;re done reading this message today!</p>

                      <p>Listen, the bottom line is this&hellip;</p>

                      <p>Although it&rsquo;s improbable you&rsquo;d ever ride a profit wave just like this, <strong><em>it&rsquo;s NOT impossible.</em></strong></p>

                      <p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve given you this example, because I want you to see for yourself the amazing potential of marijuana penny stocks.</p>

                      <p>Now the clock&rsquo;s ticking&hellip;</p>

                      <p>We&rsquo;re days away from the next wave of marijuana wealth.</p>

                      <p>And remember&hellip;</p>

                      <p>The above examples are marijuana stocks that skyrocketed when Colorado legalized marijuana&hellip;</p>

                      <p>That was just one state.</p>

                          <h3>But by November 8th, there could be at least 7 more states with fully legalized recreational pot laws. <br><br> Arizona, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada and of course California.

                      <p>This should be huge&hellip;</p>

                      <p>You&rsquo;ve already seen the proof of what happened to these small penny pot plays after Colorado legalized weed&hellip;</p>

                      <p>So imagine&hellip;</p>

                      <p>What happens when those gains are multiplied as SEVEN MORE states do the same thing that Colorado did?</p>

                      <p>And what happens when one of those states is California &mdash; our most populated state?</p>

                      <p>And then what happens as more and more states legalize pot across the country?</p>

                      <p>The amount of money you could make&hellip;</p>

                      <p>The profits&hellip;</p>

                      <p>Are simply staggering.</p>

                      <p>Need more proof?</p>

                      <p>As research firm ALG Financial put it, <em>&ldquo;The second revolution in the cannabis market is here... there is hardly anyone on Wall Street who doesn&rsquo;t see the huge potential windfalls that are on their way.&rdquo;</em></p>

                      <p>ArcView &mdash; a data and analytical research firm &mdash; is touting that we&rsquo;re about to witness the true birth of <em>&ldquo;the next great American industry .&rdquo;</em></p>

                      <p>John Ingold at <em>The Denver Post</em> reported that one business mogul in the markets believes the marijuana industry could <em>&ldquo;mint multiple billionaires&hellip;&rdquo; </em></p>

                      <p>And <em>Forbes</em> contributor Mark Fidelman adds that it <em>&ldquo;will make investors extremely wealthy .&rdquo;</em></p>

                      <div class="quotebox">

                      <p>Think about what you could do with $2.7 million.</p>

                      <p>You could look after your family and friends, pay off your mortgage and put your kids through college.</p>

                      <p>Or perhaps you&rsquo;re looking to do something a bit more extravagant&hellip;</p>

                      <p>Like drink Dom Perignon, eat caviar, drive exotic cars and mingle with high society on million-dollar yachts.</p>

                      <p>The point is we are about to witness the birth of a brand-new industry in this country.</p>

                      <p>An industry that has already proven to be incredibly successful and incredibly lucrative.</p>

                      <p>This is your chance to get in on the action.</p>

                      <p>And by utilizing the &ldquo;$50 Weed Stock Blueprint,&rdquo; you could become incredibly wealthy in less than two years&rsquo; time.</p>

                  <p style="margin-top: 0px;">What I do is simple&hellip;</p>

                  <p>I research the best new scientific ideas you can invest in&hellip; looking for incredible market catalysts that have the power to reward early investors with triple- and quadruple-digit gains.</p>

                  <p>And every month, I publish these incredible opportunities for my private readers through my investing research advisory called <em>Technology Profits Confidential</em>&hellip;</p>

                  <p><em>Technology Profits Confidential</em> is the only place in the entire world where I recommend tiny stocks that my research indicates could soar 500&ndash;1,000% or higher.</p>

                  <p>Granted, not all of my picks are guaranteed to go this high. My readers have still had the chance to see many impressive triple-digit gains.</p>

                  <p>And I can tell you &mdash; with 100% conviction &mdash; that the opportunity for early investors in the legalized marijuana markets is truly unprecedented.</p>

                  <p>We&rsquo;re talking about an entire industry dominated by small companies.</p>

                  <p>&hellip;dozens and dozens of TRUE penny pot stocks.</p>

                  <p>Now, I&rsquo;ll be the first to concede that most penny stocks are garbage.</p>

                  <p>But if you&rsquo;re avoiding ALL penny stocks, well&hellip;</p>

                  <p>You&rsquo;re costing yourself tens of thousands... even millions of dollars!</p>

                  <p>Penny stocks are infinitely important to the global economic engine.</p>

                  <p>The world <em>needs</em> these small companies.</p>

                  <p>See, small companies are the foremost breeding ground for innovation.</p>

                  <p>Heck, some of the biggest companies on Earth originated as tiny penny stocks.</p>

                  <p>Microsoft. Apple. Budweiser. Cisco.</p>

                  <p>All once penny stocks&hellip;</p>

                  <p>And now they now add hundreds of billions of dollars to our economy.</p>

                  <p>They provide jobs to over a million people.</p>

                  <p>And believe me, tomorrow&rsquo;s leaders in the weed industry are companies that you can purchase today for just pocket change.</p>

                  <p>I&rsquo;ve been carefully watching the marijuana industry develop&hellip;</p>

                  <p>I&rsquo;ve been waiting for the exact right time to get in.</p>

                  <p>And that time is NOW!</p>

                  <p>I&rsquo;ve already done my research&hellip;</p>

                  <p>And I&rsquo;ve already identified a number of penny pot stocks that have the capabilities of producing life-changing gains in the months ahead.</p>

                  <p>I&rsquo;ll give you my exclusive list in just a second&hellip;</p>

                  <p>But first, let me show you the stringent appraisal system I&rsquo;ve developed over the years for accurately predicting which penny stocks will be winners&hellip;</p>

                    <p>It&rsquo;s the only means to truly keep your portfolio safe.</p>

                    <p>Every product launch is tracked for widespread consumer appeal.</p>

                    <p>Every dollar of revenue is cross-referenced for authenticity.</p>

                    <p>I treat every company no differently than, say... Leonardo da Vinci&#39;s Codex Hammer, which Bill Gates recently bought for $30.8 million.</p>

                    <p>Or a 300-year-old Stradivarius violin, which sold for $3.9 million.</p>

                    <p>Can you imagine sending these priceless assets to auction without verifying their authenticity?</p>

                    <p>So why should your investments be treated differently?</p>

                    <p>To date, however, of the more than 4,000 stocks out there&hellip;</p>

                    <p>Only a few dozen companies have met all five criteria points.</p>

                    <p>Said a different way, only about one in every 166 stocks that pass through my filtering system will be safe enough to recommend to my readers&hellip;</p>

                    <p>Which speaks to the rigors of my appraisal process.</p>

                    <p>The amount of money a company was able to attract from private investors, pre-IPO, is infinitely important. The more money, the better.</p>

                    <p>Tons of financial backing from private investors is a surefire signal that the company is doing something extraordinary.</p>

                    <p>Think about it. Would venture capitalists put their faith (and capital) behind a mediocre idea? Never.</p>

                    <p>A coming event or announcement can send a tiny stock through the roof.</p>

                    <p>Especially ones trading for pennies a share.</p>

                    <p>Imagine owning a tiny pharmaceutical ahead of FDA drug approval.</p>

                    <p>Or a little software company before a major takeover.</p>

                    <p>Overnight gains on such news can far exceed a simple price double.</p>

                    <p>And that&rsquo;s why the opportunity in the marijuana industry is so compelling...</p>

                    <p>The ultimate catalyst is brewing right now&hellip;</p>

                    <p>And could be triggered on November 8.</p>

                    <p>That&rsquo;s when seven MORE states from all over the country could pass new recreational marijuana legislation&hellip;</p>

                    <p>And even more may adopt medical marijuana programs!</p>

                      <p>Remember this &mdash; to make the most money possible, it&rsquo;s crucial to invest BEFORE November 8.</p>

                      <p>Already, in just the past few months, more than two dozen marijuana penny stocks have seen their share prices surge by up to 20%, 50% even 100%.</p>

                      <p>Stocks like:</p>

                      <p>And many, many more&hellip;</p>

                      <p>But make no mistake, this is just the beginning.</p>

                      <p>Every stock I&rsquo;ve just mentioned still trades for PENNIES A SHARE.</p>

                      <p>If you take action right now, you can easily turn a tiny grubstake of $50 into an absolute windfall fortune.</p>

                      <p>Remember, it&rsquo;s happened before.</p>

                      <p>Why not have it happen to you starting this November?</p>

                      <p>So here&rsquo;s the deal&hellip;</p>

                      <p>I told you before that there are over 4,000 companies that trade on the stock market&hellip;</p>

                      <p>Exactly 350 of them are pot plays&hellip;</p>

                      <p>And I&rsquo;ve run every single one of those 350 companies through my five-part filtering system&hellip;</p>

                      <p>And based on my stringent five-part assessment of the companies in the marijuana industry, I&rsquo;ve pinpointed exactly four penny pot stocks&hellip;</p>

                      <p>That can eventually make you a millionaire.</p>

                     <p>Now, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve heard of pain drugs like OxyContin, hydrocodone and Percocet.</p>

                    <p>Chances are good you&rsquo;ve even been prescribed these drugs by your doctor following a major (and even minor) surgery.</p>

                    <p>In 2012 alone, 259 million prescriptions for painkillers were filled. That is more than enough for every adult in the United States to take them for at least a month.</p>

                    <p>And those numbers have built incredible wealth for the companies manufacturing these drugs.</p>

                    <p>The Sackler family, which owned and controlled Purdue Pharma, became one of the richest families in America after introducing OxyContin in 1996.</p>

                    <p>Net sales of OxyContin alone average around $3.1 billion per year. And Endo Pharmaceuticals &mdash; the company that makes the painkiller Percocet &mdash; generate profits of about $122 million per year.</p>

                    <p>In other words, these types of drugs can be VERY profitable.</p>

                    <p>Of course, today&rsquo;s painkillers are derived from drugs like opium&hellip; and morphine.</p>

                    <p>Which make them very dangerous, too.</p>

                    <p>According to the Centers for Disease Control, the United States is in the midst of an opioid overdose epidemic.</p>

                    <p>The truth is opioids killed more than 28,000 people in 2014, more than any year on record.</p>

                    <p>You see, serious pain drugs are a horrible trade-off &mdash; a deal with the devil, if you will.</p>

                    <p>You take the drug and your unbearable pain goes away&hellip; but you may end up addicted (just ask Rush Limbaugh or Brett Favre), homeless or even dead from an overdose.</p>

                  <p>You see, they&rsquo;ve already developed the &ldquo;next generation&rdquo; painkiller medication.</p>

                  <p>I&rsquo;m talking about a medication that could be just as effective as opioid-based pain drugs&hellip; but without all of the nasty side effects.</p>

                  <p>A pain medication that you aren&rsquo;t likely to become addicted to&hellip; and a pain medication that is much, much safer.</p>

                  <p>Not only that&hellip; but this next-generation painkiller has already cleared Phase 1 and Phase 2 testing with the FDA.</p>

                  <p>And as you can imagine, in the case of prescription medicines, it&rsquo;s the first company to market that will hit the largest jackpot.</p>

                  <p>As I&rsquo;ve shown you, this is a market that&rsquo;s worth billions and billions of dollars&hellip; and this microcap company could easily dominate the entire market.</p>

                  <p>And it gets even better&hellip;</p>

                  <p>Because this same company has three other drugs in the pipeline&hellip; which are being tested as we speak.</p>

                  <p>You see, what this company has discovered &mdash; through new research &mdash; is something called the endogenous system&hellip; which is directly linked to a number of physiological processes including pain and inflammation. And a special chemical found in marijuana can regulate the effects of acute and chronic pain.</p>

                  <p>In fact, according to Roger Pertwee, a pharmacologist at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland, we&rsquo;re talking about &ldquo;a potential wonder drug.&rdquo;</p>

                  <p>I fully expect shares of this penny pot company to start to skyrocket by 500% or more following the election cycle on November 8.</p>

                  <p>And I&rsquo;ll tell you everything you need to know in my comprehensive report.</p>

                    <p>However, I can tell you that they were just awarded a medical marijuana sublicense to a patent from the U.S. government&hellip; and they have 20 more marijuana patents currently under review.</p>

                    <p>Bottom line...</p>

                    <p>The core tech behind drones will certainly also make fortunes for fast movers like you.</p>

                        <p>One interesting thing about drone technology is, though it may have been developed for military uses, the consumer angles to profit from unmanned flight are incredible.</p>

                        <p>To give you one example, you know how forest fires sometimes get quickly out of control before anyone knows what&rsquo;s going on?</p>

                    <p>The ranger would never have to leave his or her vehicle.</p>

                    <p>And fires could be spotted more quickly, saving billions per year in damage and loss of property.</p>

                    <p>That&rsquo;s just one example. Good, safe, reliable drones are going to save lives and make fast-moving investors a mint. You get the full story in your copy of your bonus report, <strong><em>Airdropped Profits</em></strong>.</p>

                      <p><em>Time</em> magazine, the <em>Financial Times</em>, <em>Fortune</em>&hellip; they&rsquo;ve all written and raved about the possibilities once we can interact inside of virtual worlds.</p>

                      <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">A second company with cutting-edge motion sensor technology, designed to make every virtual world experience as smooth and lifelike as reality.</p>
